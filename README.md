## Instructions

Load the feed reader test suite by unzipping all of the files and folders to a directory on your computer, and open the index.html file in your favorite browser. You can add or modify the current specs by editing the "feedreader.js" file in the "jasmine/spec" directory.

The current specs test four main features of the feed reader:

- If there are RSS feeds defined in the array being used to populate the content, and whether the items have URLs and names.

- If the popup menu that lets you select different feeds is hidden by default, and if it successfully shows when clicking the hamburger menu at the upper left.

- If there are feed items inside the feed container once the function that populates them runs.

- If the content inside the feed container changes if a new feed is selected.

The base HTML, CSS, and most Javascript coding was provided by Udacity.

The coding in the feedreader.js file was done by me, Stephen Harding.
